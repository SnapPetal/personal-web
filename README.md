## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 25+
- Maven 3.9.16+
- Docker (Spring Boot auto-starts PostgreSQL via Docker Compose)
- OpenAI API key and AWS credentials (Polly, S3, S3 Vectors, SES)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnapPetal/personal-web.git
cd personal-web
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS, OpenAI, and Nextcloud credentials
mvn -f design-system/pom.xml install -DskipTests
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

### Booking availability assistant

The booking page includes a public, read-only availability assistant. The browser sends its IANA timezone
to `chat.thonbecker.biz`; the assistant defaults to `America/Chicago` when no timezone is supplied. The
Cloudflare Worker calls this endpoint on PersonalWeb:

```text
GET /booking/api/availability?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD&timezone=America%2FChicago
```

The endpoint returns active meeting types and available start/end times only. It does not return attendee
records and cannot create, cancel, or modify bookings. Keep this endpoint and the widget read-only. Deploy
PersonalWeb before deploying changes to the public chat Worker so its availability data source is live.

The local `design-system` Maven module packages the shared CSS and JavaScript as a WebJar. Its Maven build installs a pinned Node/npm runtime, runs `npm ci`, applies the Airbnb ESLint configuration, and runs Prettier/Stylelint for CSS before packaging. The Spring application consumes the resulting WebJar through `/webjars/personal-design-system/1.0.0/`.

For Skatetricks transcoding, set `SKATETRICKS_MEDIACONVERT_ROLE_ARN` from the HomeWeb CDK `MediaConvertRoleArn` output. Do not set `SKATETRICKS_MEDIACONVERT_ENDPOINT`; the app discovers the correct account-specific endpoint automatically via `DescribeEndpoints`.

Skatetricks accepts user-uploaded video files, converts them to MP4, publishes them to the CDN, and analyzes the uploaded video.

Skatetricks video analysis extracts duration-aware sequential frames from uploaded/imported MP4s before calling OpenAI vision. Tune `SKATETRICKS_ANALYSIS_MAX_FRAMES` if production needs more or fewer images per analysis; the default is `24`.

## Authentication

Trivia and Landscape use the shared magic-link authentication flow. A visitor enters an email address at `/auth/login`, receives a one-time link, and receives a 24-hour authenticated session after confirming it. Login links expire after 15 minutes and are single-use.

Spring Security resolves the `PERSONALWEB_AUTH_SESSION` cookie into the authenticated principal for every request. `/trivia` and `/landscape/**` require authentication and redirect unauthenticated visitors to login. After signing in, visitors return to the module they originally requested.

Trivia WebSocket commands use the authenticated principal as the player and creator identity. Client-supplied player IDs are not trusted, and unauthenticated quiz commands are rejected.

Authentication data is stored in the `identity` database schema:

- `identity.users` and `identity.user_profiles` store user records.
- `identity.user_login_tokens` stores hashed, expiring one-time login tokens.
- `identity.user_sessions` stores hashed session tokens, expiration, and revocation state.

An hourly ShedLock-protected cleanup job removes expired login tokens and expired or revoked sessions. Those magic-link sessions are for Trivia and Landscape only; booking administration does not use magic links or a password. It is accessed from the private Cloudflare OS control plane, which forwards the administrator's Cloudflare Access JWT to Spring's resource server.

The booking admin API is under `/booking/admin/api/**` and requires a valid Cloudflare Access JWT whose audience matches `PERSONAL_CF_ACCESS_AUDIENCE` and whose email matches `PERSONAL_CF_ACCESS_ADMIN_EMAIL`. The Cloudflare OS Worker uses `https://app.thonbecker.biz` as the Spring origin; `booking.thonbecker.biz` remains the public booking site.

Production Spring configuration requires:

```text
PERSONAL_CF_ACCESS_ISSUER
PERSONAL_CF_ACCESS_AUDIENCE
PERSONAL_CF_ACCESS_ADMIN_EMAIL
```

## Architecture

### Stack

|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend**   | Spring Boot 4, Spring Modulith, Spring AI, Spring Security                         |
| **AI/ML**     | Spring AI with OpenAI chat, vision, embeddings, image generation; DJL PyTorch YOLO |
| **Database**  | PostgreSQL 18, Liquibase migrations, Caffeine cache                                |
| **Frontend**  | Thymeleaf, HTMX, Alpine.js, Bootstrap 5, Fabric.js, Godot HTML5, WebJars           |
| **Real-time** | STOMP over SockJS (trivia, skatetricks); raw WebSocket (Godot tank game)           |

### Modules

```
src/main/java/biz/thonbecker/personal/
├── foosball/       # Game tracking, stats, tournaments, ELO rating
├── trivia/         # AI-powered FPU trivia, WebSocket multiplayer
├── skatetricks/    # YOLO pose estimation + OpenAI vision trick detection
├── landscape/      # AI-powered landscape planning with USDA plant data
├── booking/        # Appointment scheduling with auto-availability
├── tankgame/       # Tank game progression and raw WebSocket prototype
├── user/           # User management
├── calendar/       # Nextcloud CalDAV integration with calendar sync
├── notification/   # Event-driven email notifications via AWS SES
├── content/        # Bible verse, Dad jokes (Polly TTS + S3)
└── shared/         # Infrastructure configuration (Security, Cache, AWS, WebSocket)
```

Each module follows: `api/` (exported events/interfaces) | `domain/` (pure Java models) | `platform/` (services, persistence, controllers)

Cross-module communication is event-driven only — no module calls another module's service directly.

### Shared Design System

The canonical shared CSS lives in `design-system/src/main/resources/` and is packaged as a local WebJar. Update the design-system sources, then run:

```bash
mvn -f design-system/pom.xml install -DskipTests
```

This runs the WebJar's frontend checks and produces `design-system/target/personal-design-system-1.0.0.jar`. The static site keeps its own generated CSS bundle in `static-site/design-system.css`.

## Development

```bash
mvn test                    # Run all tests
mvn verify                  # Run integration/verification tests
mvn spotless:apply          # Apply Java, JS, Markdown, and POM formatting
mvn -f design-system/pom.xml install -DskipTests  # Build and lint the local design-system WebJar
mvn clean package           # Build production jar
```

### Godot tank game

The tank game client lives in `godot/tankgame` and is written in GDScript. It is
exported for the browser and served by Spring Boot from `/tankgame/`. The export
is intentionally a small offline prototype with a raw WebSocket connection to
`/tankgame-ws`; this validates the browser delivery and connection path before
the authoritative multiplayer simulation is moved behind that protocol.

When Godot export templates are installed locally, export the client with:

```bash
./scripts/export-godot-tankgame.sh
```

GitHub Actions performs this export before packaging the Spring Boot application,
so the production JAR contains the current Godot web build. Use Godot 4.7 for
local development to match CI.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger GitHub Actions, which builds a Docker image via Spring Boot Buildpacks (Paketo, Java 25) and publishes it for deployment.

For Lightsail Linux instance rollouts over SSH, use [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) and [`scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh`](scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh). Deploy the Cloudflare OS control plane separately from the `cloudflare-os-personal` repository; its booking integration must be deployed after the Spring origin and Access settings are available.
