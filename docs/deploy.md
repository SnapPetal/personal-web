# Deployment

This repository builds and publishes the PersonalWeb container image from pushes to `main`.
The published image is:

- `public.ecr.aws/p0w8z2j2/personal:latest`

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/aws-deploy.yml` owns the PersonalWeb release. It builds and publishes the image through GitHub OIDC, uploads the static site, refreshes only the `personal-website` service in the shared Lightsail Compose stack, and verifies all three public domains. The shared Compose topology, nginx, certificates, and unrelated host services remain owned by `nextcloud-aws`.

## GitHub Actions OIDC

The deploy workflow expects a GitHub secret named `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` that contains the IAM role ARN to assume through OIDC.

AWS trust policy for the role should restrict access to this repository and branch:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::664759038511:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:SnapPetal/personal-web:ref:refs/heads/main"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The role also needs permissions to authenticate to ECR Public and push the image used by the deploy workflow.
At minimum, AWS requires `ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken` and `sts:GetServiceBearerToken` for the login step, plus push permissions on the public repository.

## Lightsail Linux Instance

Use [`scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh`](../scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh) to deploy the latest published image to the Lightsail host over SSH.

Use [`scripts/deploy-personalweb.sh`](../scripts/deploy-personalweb.sh) for custom hosts, alternate compose paths, or other SSH targets.

Known production target from `nextcloud-aws`:

- SSH: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightsail.pem ubuntu@18.213.161.133`
- Remote app repo: `~/nextcloud-aws`
- Compose service: `personal-website`
- Published port: `127.0.0.1:3003 -> 8080`
- Public site: `https://thonbecker.biz`

### Domain split

The production host already runs host-managed nginx in the `nextcloud-aws` repository; do not add another Caddy or nginx container. The intended routing is:

- `thonbecker.biz` and `www.thonbecker.biz` serve the files from `static-site/` at `/var/www/thonbecker-static`.
- `booking.thonbecker.biz` proxies only booking and shared asset paths to `127.0.0.1:3003`.
- `app.thonbecker.biz` redirects `/` to `https://thonbecker.biz` and proxies the complete Spring
  Boot application (including WebSockets) for all other paths.

The private Cloudflare OS booking integration uses `https://app.thonbecker.biz` as its upstream. Do not point `BOOKING_ADMIN_BASE_URL` at `booking.thonbecker.biz`; that hostname is reserved for the public booking experience. The Worker forwards the Cloudflare Access JWT in `Authorization: Bearer` form to Spring.

An nginx reference is available at [`deploy/lightsail/nginx-domains.conf.example`](../deploy/lightsail/nginx-domains.conf.example). The authoritative production virtual hosts must live in `nextcloud-aws/nginx` so its deployment workflow and Certbot manage them.

Deploy the apex static files independently with:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-lightsail-static.sh
```

Landscape plans are owned by the authenticated magic-link user and do not use Cloudflare Access. Booking administration is protected by Cloudflare Access and managed from the private Cloudflare OS control plane. Configure the same issuer, audience, and administrator email in both Cloudflare OS (`deployment.jsonc`) and the Spring deployment environment. The audience must match exactly.

### Required inputs

- `DEPLOY_HOST`
  The SSH host or alias for the Lightsail instance.

### Optional inputs

- `DEPLOY_USER`
  SSH user. If omitted, the current user is used.
- `IMAGE_REF`
  Container image to deploy.
  Default: `public.ecr.aws/p0w8z2j2/personal:latest`
- `REMOTE_APP_DIR`
  Remote application directory for compose-based deployment.
  Default: `~/nextcloud-aws`
- `REMOTE_COMPOSE_FILE`
  Compose file path relative to `REMOTE_APP_DIR`.
  Default: `docker-compose.yml`
- `REMOTE_COMPOSE_SERVICE`
  Compose service to refresh.
  Default: `personal-website`
- `REMOTE_DEPLOY_COMMAND`
  Exact remote shell command to run instead of the default compose rollout.

## Default deployment mode

If `REMOTE_DEPLOY_COMMAND` is not provided, the script assumes the server uses `docker compose` and that the compose file consumes `PERSONALWEB_IMAGE`.

The default remote rollout is:

```bash
cd "$REMOTE_APP_DIR"
docker pull "$IMAGE_REF"
docker compose -f "$REMOTE_COMPOSE_FILE" up -d --no-deps "$REMOTE_COMPOSE_SERVICE"
docker image prune -f
```

This matches the current `nextcloud-aws` production setup, where the `personal-website` service is pinned to `public.ecr.aws/p0w8z2j2/personal:latest` inside the compose file.

## Examples

Deploy the latest image to the current Lightsail host:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh
```

Deploy a specific image tag:

```bash
IMAGE_REF=public.ecr.aws/p0w8z2j2/personal:d052ba2 \
./scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh
```

Deploy to the current production IP directly:

```bash
DEPLOY_HOST=18.213.161.133 \
DEPLOY_USER=ubuntu \
./scripts/deploy-lightsail-personalweb.sh
```

Use an explicit remote command instead of compose:

```bash
DEPLOY_HOST=personal-lightsail \
REMOTE_DEPLOY_COMMAND='sudo systemctl restart personalweb' \
./scripts/deploy-personalweb.sh
```

## Recommended server setup

For the default compose mode, keep a compose file on the Lightsail host that references the image through an environment variable:

```yaml
services:
  personalweb:
    image: ${PERSONALWEB_IMAGE:-public.ecr.aws/p0w8z2j2/personal:latest}
    env_file:
      - .env.personalweb
```

That keeps the server-side deployment stable while allowing the image tag to be overridden from the script.

The PersonalWeb container must receive these runtime AI variables:

```bash
PERSONAL_OPENAI_API_KEY=
PERSONAL_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
PERSONAL_OPENAI_TRIVIA_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
PERSONAL_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
PERSONAL_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1024
PERSONAL_OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL=dall-e-3
```

For production, store the OpenAI key in Secrets Manager as `personalweb/openai-api-key` from the HomeWeb CDK stack. The `nextcloud-aws` deployment runs `scripts/sync-personalweb-openai-secret.sh` before restarting containers, which writes `PERSONAL_OPENAI_API_KEY` and the default model variables into the private server-side `.env` consumed by compose. The Spring app still reads `PERSONAL_OPENAI_API_KEY`; Secrets Manager is the source of truth for the secret value.

The current production compose file in `nextcloud-aws` does not use an image variable for the personal site. It currently references:

```yaml
personal-website:
  image: public.ecr.aws/p0w8z2j2/personal:latest
```

That means the default deployment path here is intended for `latest`. If you want tagged-image rollouts from this repo, the remote compose file should be updated to accept a variable-driven image reference.
